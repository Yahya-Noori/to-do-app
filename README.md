This To-Do app allows users to create, view, edit, mark as completed, and delete tasks. The main features include adding tasks with due dates, displaying all tasks in a table, editing tasks, filtering tasks by status (all, pending, completed), and deleting individual or all tasks. Notifications inform users of successful actions such as adding, editing, or deleting tasks.

The <body> contains sections for managing tasks, adding tasks, filtering tasks, and displaying tasks in a table format.

It includes buttons for adding, editing, filtering, and deleting tasks, along with an alert message section for user notifications.

CSS:
The styles for the web page are defined in a CSS file linked to the HTML file through <link rel="stylesheet" href="style/style.css">.

The body is styled with a specific font and centered layout.

Various elements like the task manager container, title, input fields, buttons, and alert messages are styled using CSS.

Specific classes are used to style buttons, tables, and alert messages to make the design user-friendly and visually appealing.
